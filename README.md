# Correlator

The task of this project was to correlate two literay works and find their correlation with each other. For instance, if a literary work was fed through this code, it will give you all the words that appear in the work and their respective frequencies. 
After calculating the normalized frequency of the words that appear in the texts, we modified Euclidien Algorithm in order to find the correlation between two works. 
In order to process large tect files such as a literary work, we used BST, AVL tree and a hash Table to store the words. The purpose of using all three data structure was to see which one works the best in terms of time and memory complexity.
